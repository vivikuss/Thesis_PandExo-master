THE PHOENIX MODELS BY FRANCE ALLARD AND COLLABORATORS

These models are for stars/brown dwarfs/planets (without irradiation), 
with a cloud model. They use static, spherical symmetric, 1D simulations 
to completely describe the atmospheric emission spectrum. The models account 
for the formation of molecular bands, such as those of water vapor, methane, 
or titanium dioxide, solving for the transfer equation over more than 20,000 
wavelength points on average - producing synthetic spectra with 2 Angstrom
resolution. The line selection is repeated at each iteration of the model
until it has converged, and the thermal structure obtained. The models here
are calculated with a cloud model, valid across the entire parameter range.

The models in this suite were resampled to reduce the number of points from the 
original models. We reduce it to 5K across the 900 to 30microns wavelength range.
Each directory in this suite includes all the models for a given metallicity. For
example "phoenixm10" includes all the models for [M/H]=-1.0, where "m" is for minus
and "p" is for plus. Each of the files in these directories is for a single Teff.
These fits files have columns for different log_g. For example, the column for 
log_g = 4.0 has column name g40, while that for log_g=3.0 has column g30.
For all metallicities, except for [M/H]= 0.0, each model includes columns for 
all log_gs in the range between 0.0 and 5.5. Those log_gs for which there are no 
phoenix models have FLAM=0 for all wavelengths.

We are in the process of replacing these models with an updated version that includes 
more data points. The new models will have 100K points for each log_g. We have 
done this only for models with metallicity = 0.0. These files are also slightly
different from the previous cases in which each file includes columns only for 
those log_gs for which the models exist. Not all the Teffs have the full range 
of log_gs, which in this case goes from 0.0 to 6.0. The list of 
log_g's included, as well as those missing, is provided in the header[0] of 
each file. Note also that we had to redownload the orignial models from the
author's site at https://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/Grids/BT-Settl/AGSS2009/SPECTRA/. The
models for metallicity = 0.0 and hot stars in this download 
(BT-Settl_M-0.0_a+0.0_hot.tar), only included stars with Teff > 2600. 
We, therefore, downloaded the BT-Settl_M-0.0_cool.tar to add stars with Teff between
2000 and 2600, which was the case for our original models. Note that in this new
set, as well as our original models, there were casese where there were four spectra 
per file (the wavelengths were repeated four times within a given file), where each
consisted of about 100K points. For these cases, we took only the first set of
wavelengths and fluxes. However, there are a few cases where the full 400K+ points
contained no repeated wavelengths.
